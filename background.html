        <h3>~ The Disappearance of Lyla Bell ~</h3>
        <div>
            <img class="background" src="images/building.jpg">
            <p class="story">	Lyla Bell is the oldest of three daughters. She grew up with her mother and father in Greenville, North Carolina. At age three, her parents noticed that she was advancing particularly quickly relative to her age. She was performing double digit multiplication and reading adult chapter books by age 4. Her parents took her to an education specialist to see what they should do for school, since she was clearly beyond the level of kindergarten that she was scheduled to start the coming fall. The specialist gave Lyla a series of tests and reported the results back to the parents with amazement, saying that Lyla was performing at a teenage level. Based on her scores, the specialist told Lyla’s parents that Lyla’s file was automatically placed into a government record of extremely gifted individuals. </p>
                    <p class="story">Lyla’s parents, Stephen and Lindsay Bell, knew that Lyla would be spinning her wheels in public school, but they also didn’t want to send her to an elite private school with significantly older students. They decided they would hire their nanny Maria to homeschool her. Mr. and Mrs. Bell purchased homeschool materials for 6th through 8th grade and instructed Maria to dispense them to Lyla as needed. During these lessons, Maria began to notice something strange. Lyla would disappear for long stretches of time. Maria searched the house and yard whenever she went missing but was unable to find her anywhere. However, Lyla would always return for meals, her advanced daily work completed, saying that she had been taking a potty break. When Maria reported this to Mr. and Mrs. Bell, they thanked her for her concern, but saw no problem if Lyla was getting her work done. </p>
                    <p class="story">When Lyla turned 7, she began to complain of headaches. Her distress grew steadily  until one day, as she was getting up to cross the room, she collapsed to the floor. Unable to rouse her,  Mr. and Mrs. Bell rushed her to the emergency room at Union Hospital. The physician, Dr. Bastrop, ran an MRI brain scan which showed that Lyla’s brain appeared normal. However, follow-up tests showed unusual activity in the area of the brain called the claustrum. Since the claustrum was an area which modern medicine did not know a great deal about, Dr. Bastrop asked Lyla’s parents if they would be willing to enroll Lyla in an observational study. Her parents were hesitant, but when Dr. Bastrop assured them that the study was noninvasive and would only collect information that may help Lyla with the pain, they consented. Dr. Bastrop told Lyla to drink more water, prescribed her a strong anti-inflammatory, and requested that Lyla return every three months for routine scans.
                    The headaches did not go away. Lyla’s parents took her to several other medical offices for second opinions. One place was called Shadow Ridge, a clinic that a colleague of Mr. Bell recommended. He told Mr. Bell that it was one of the highest-rated in the country for neuropediatrics. The doctors at Shadow Ridge were particularly interested in Lyla, as her case showed some similarities with other young patients who also scored in the highest percentiles of cognitive ability. They told Mr. and Mrs. Bell that they had a pioneering treatment, a combination of meditation, exercise, and a new class of antipsychotic medication. The Bell’s were horrified to hear the mention of an antipsychotic as a treatment for their little girl, but the doctors reassured them that these drugs were only labeled as such due to an obsolete classification system. Additionally, the clinicians had seen excellent results so far. Extremely reluctant to expose their young child to psychiatric medication, they nevertheless relented after Lyla’s nightly crying intensified. 
                Almost immediately, the headaches subsided, and Lyla returned to her cheerful self. However, she began to spend a great deal of time alone in her room meditating. She demanded that she be left undisturbed during these times, and would become enraged if anybody interrupted her. Because she was so pleasant to be around otherwise, and as she was performing so well in her schoolwork, Lyla’s parents allowed this. Lyla made a homemade ‘Please Stay Out’ sign with a picture of a meditating giraffe. Lyla’s parents forbid her two sisters from entering the room whenever Lyla hung the sign on her door.  
                Lyla continued with monthly check-ups at Shadow Ridge, as well as visits to Union Hospital at the persistence of Dr. Bastrop. Then, on Lyla’s ninth birthday, two men claiming to be agents from the CIA came to the Bell House asking for Lyla. Mr. and Mrs. Bell refused to allow the men to talk to their nine year old daughter. The men reported that it was a matter of government security to have a short, private conversation with Lyla, and that if they did not do it now, they would be back with a warrant for Mr. and Mrs. Bell’s arrest for obstructing justice. Not the type to be bullied, the parents slammed the door and returned to cutting Lyla’s cake.
                The following week, a black unmarked SUV pulled into the Bell’s house while Mr. and Mrs. Bell were at work and the children were at home with Maria. When Maria answered the door and saw several men in black suits and sunglasses, she panicked and froze. The men pushed into the house and called out for Lyla. Stella, Lyla’s 6 year old agreeable but rule-following sister, told the men that they were not allowed to talk to Lyla right now, because she was in her room meditating. The two men went up to her room, did not heed the ‘Please Stay Out’ giraffe sign, and opened the door. They found only an empty room. They searched throughout the house but could not find any sign of Lyla. The men threatened to take Maria into custody if Maria did not reveal Lyla’s whereabouts. At that moment they heard a toilet flush, and Lyla emerged out of the bathroom.
                The men swivelled their heads towards Lyla and descended upon her. As one of the men bent to pick her up, Lyla clutched her head and started screaming. The man closest to her immediately went limp and collapsed. A blinding light flashed, and the electricity throughout the house went out. A gunshot sounded, followed by some muffled sounds and screeching tires.
                Later that evening, Mrs. Bell returned to their home to find the door open, and both Maria and Lyla missing. Terrified, she immediately called the police and reported that her child was gone. 
                Mr. Bell returned shortly after. His wife was at his car door before he could get out, screaming through tears that their daughter was gone. “You didn’t do anything to stop it! Where were you?! Why haven’t you answered your phone?!” Mr. Bell could not believe what he heard, and ran through the house shouting for Lyla. At the kitchen table, Stella was sitting calmly, patting the back of her sobbing little sister, Mae.

                Mr. and Mrs. Bell lost weeks of sleep as they searched everywhere for Lyla. When they called the CIA, they were transferred to an officer who reported that he knew nothing about their daughter and suggested they call the local police. After the police search turned up fruitless, the Bells hired a private detective. The detective came back after several weeks and told the Bell’s that she found nothing and could not in good conscience continue to take their money.
                One day Dr. Bastrop from Union Hospital called to tell them Lyla had missed her three month check up. Mrs. Bell flung her phone into the wall in disgust. But the call reminded Mr. Bell that they hadn’t heard from anybody at Shadow Ridge, who usually called diligently to confirm Lyla’s upcoming appointments. Mr. Bell phoned the Shadow Ridge office and was connected with a Dr. Serroe, whom he had never spoken with before. Dr. Serroe said he had been recently assigned to Lyla’s case and apologized for his lack of timeliness as he caught up with all of his new patients. He asked Mr. Bell to come to the office to discuss something he had discovered when looking through Lyla’s charts. 
                Mr. and Mrs. Bell packed up their remaining children and drove to Shadow Ridge the following day. Dr. Serroe met them in front of the clinic and motioned for them to sit at a bench in the parking lot. Mr. and Mrs. Bell found this highly unusual, but followed him. Serroe showed that in Lyla’s file, there were several notes that vaguely mentioned Lyla’s “accelerating condition”. He asked whether they knew what that referred to, because from her charts it seemed as if Lyla’s condition was stable. The bewildered parents shook their heads. Dr. Serroe asked if he might be able to take a look at Lyla today, if she was present. The parents exchanged a look and then explained that Lyla had been taken from them more than a month ago by people who claimed to be in the CIA. Dr. Serroe listened with surprised interest as the Bells recapitulated their harrowing tale. He apologized for bothering them in their troubling times, and told them to please call and let him know when they found Lyla. Mrs. Bell took it as a small kindness that Dr. Serroe had said “when” they find Lyla, and not “if”. 
                
                ------------
                
                A few years later, the Bells’ life had developed into a new normal. It was an unspoken agreement to not mention Lyla’s name. The family was eating lunch when there was a knock on the door. Mr. Bell went to answer it and found Dr. Serroe. Mrs. Bell leapt to the door to join her husband. Dr. Serroe nodded grimly, noticing the recognition in their eyes.
                “I have something I wanted to give you. I found it a couple days ago, and I’m sorry it has taken me so long to deliver it. I should have called immediately, but, I -” he stammered for a couple moments, then continued, “I’ve been going to all the parents in person.”
                The Bells looked at each other. Mrs. Bell opened her mouth to speak, but Dr. Serroe continued.
                “Lyla” (Mrs. Bell cringed involuntarily at hearing the name) “was not the only gifted child to come to Shadow Ridge. There were several others. Others that also went missing. I had a suspicion, ever since talking with you several years ago, that something was not quite right at that place. At first I kept my head down, but…” Dr. Serroe hesitated, biingt his lip. “Oh, you don’t want to hear all my story, and my excuses, I’m sure. But, here, take this.”
                Dr. Serroe ungracefully shoved a binder into Mr. Bell’s hands. “There are journal entries in there written by your daughter. Some quite recently, you’ll find.”
                Both Mr. and Mrs. Bell eyes shot open. As one, they opened their mouths to speak, but again Dr. Serroe cut them off before they could say anything.
                “I assure you, I don’t know where she is. I wish I did. I don’t know where any of them are. But I found that journal in a locked room on one of the upper floors when I was looking for some old medical journals. There were others, written by other young patients that also went missing, up there too. And I’m giving them to the parents.”
                Mrs. Bell could not contain herself any longer and blurted out, “But that means somebody there knows! Somebody knows where my daughter is! You have to go and ask whoever is in charge and -”
                Dr. Serroe cut her off. “Ma’am, I am never going back there. Right after I took that box of journals, they sealed the whole building, nobody in or out. Somebody must have noticed they were gone. I literally was about to jump out the window and run when I realized I would never get far, or get the journals to the parents, if they knew it was me who took them.” 
                A branch cracked behind Dr. Serroe and he whipped his head over his shoulder, his eyes darting around, scanning the yard. Then he let out a nervous chuckle, “Sorry, a little paranoid I guess, or, rightfully nervous, or…” he glanced back at the wide eyes of Mr. and Mrs. Bell. “Nevermind. I need to go. I’m sure you can appreciate that the other parents would like to know as soon as possible.” He moved off towards his car, then turned back, not meeting their eyes. “Read it,” he nodded his head towards the binder in Mr. Bell’s hands, “your daughter wrote more clearly than most of the others. I’m sure you’ll be able to understand it better than me.” Then he hustled back to his car.
                “Wait! There has to be -” Mrs. Bell shouted towards the rapidly departing figure, and took a step towards the driveway.
                “Read it!” Dr. Serroe yelled over his shoulder. Then he jumped into the car, fired the ignition, and sped off.
                Just then Mae appeared at the doorway between the dining room and the foyer. “Who was that?”
                    Mr. Bell looked down at the binder and noticed his hands were trembling. He reached and opened to the first page.
