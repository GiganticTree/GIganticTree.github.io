                <h3>Short Version</h3>
                <p>Lyla Bell is a young girl and oldest daughter of a North Carolinian family. She is very smart. When she turned six, she began to suffer from increasingly painful headaches. Her primary doctor was unsuccessful in treating Lyla, so her parents took her to a clinic called Shadow Ridge based on the recommendation of a family friend.</p>
                <p>The doctors at Shadow Ridge disclosed that they had seen several other high-functioning patients similar to Lyla. They suggested a treatment plan consisting of meditation, exercise, and an experimental medication. They also requested that Lyla return for monthly check-ups to follow her progress. Her parents, hesitant to expose their child to experimental drugs, eventually consented when Lyla’s condition worsened.</p>
                <p>The treatment proved effective in reducing Lyla’s headaches, but she began to spend long periods of time meditating alone in her room. Lyla would become upset if she were ever disturbed during her meditation. She continued to show remarkable performance in her schoolwork and dutifully returned for monthly checkups at Shadow Ridge.</p>
                <p>On Lyla’s ninth birthday, two men claiming to be from the CIA came to Lyla’s house asking to speak with her. They reported that, based on their records, Lyla represented a potential threat to national security. Lyla’s parents refused to allow the men to talk with Lyla.</p>
                <p>A few weeks later, Mrs. Bell returned from work and discovered Lyla and the nanny had disappeared. Mr. Bell arrived shortly after and phoned the police. Weeks of searching commenced, to no avail. Lyla was nowhere to be found.</p>
                <p>Two years later, a doctor from Shadow Ridge came to the Bell’s house. He told a shocked Mr. and Mrs. Bell that he had recently discovered a journal, written by Lyla, with entries up to the present date. Visibly distressed, the doctor gave the journal to Lyla’s parents and left in a hurry. </p>
                <p>The journal was filled with puzzles that Mr. and Mrs. Bell knew would help them find their daughter, but they could not solve the puzzles on their own. They began to look for help in deciphering the journal and finding their daughter.                    </p>
                <p>*If you accept the task, you will be given a copy of Lyla’s journal. It is filled with entries that reveal what happened to her and where she is. Unfortunately, the entries are somewhat encrypted, and have information missing. Investigate various locations around ECU campus and the surrounding town to uncover the missing information and solve the mystery. Lyla’s freedom is in your hands.*</p>

                <h3>Long Version</h3>
                <p>	Lyla Bell is the oldest of three daughters. She grew up with her mother and father in Greenville, North Carolina. By age three, her parents were certain that Lyla was advancing particularly quickly for her age. Her parents took Lyla to a pediatric specialist to see what they should do. The specialist gave Lyla a series of tests, and the results indicated that Lyla was performing at a teenage level. Based on her scores, the specialist told Lyla’s parents that Lyla’s scores automatically placed her into a government record of gifted individuals.                     </p>
                <p>	When Lyla turned six, she began to complain of headaches. Her distress grew steadily  until one day, as she was getting up to cross the room, she collapsed to the floor. Unable to rouse her, Mr. and Mrs. Bell rushed her to the emergency room.</p>
                <p> The doctor ran an MRI scan which showed that Lyla’s brain, though appearing normal, displayed unusual activity in an area of the brain called the claustrum. The doctor asked Lyla’s parents if they would be willing to enroll Lyla in an observational study. Her parents were hesitant, but when the doctor assured them that the study was noninvasive and would only collect information that may help Lyla with the pain, they consented. The doctor told Lyla to drink more water, prescribed her a strong anti-inflammatory, and requested that Lyla return every three months for routine scans.                   </p>
                <p>	Unfortunately, the headaches did not go away. Disturbed by Lyla’s suffering, Lyla’s parents looked for a second opinion. Their search led them to Shadow Ridge, a clinic that a colleague of Mr. Bell recommended. The doctors at Shadow Ridge showed immediate interest in Lyla, as her case showed similarities to other young patients who also scored in the highest percentiles of cognitive ability. They told Mr. and Mrs. Bell that they had a pioneering treatment: a combination of meditation, exercise, and a new experimental medication. Reluctant to expose their young child to unapproved medication, they nevertheless relented after Lyla’s nightly crying intensified. </p>
                <p>Almost immediately, the headaches subsided. Lyla returned to her cheerful self. However, she began to spend a great deal of time alone in her room meditating. She demanded that she be left undisturbed during these times, and would become upset if anybody interrupted her. Because she was so pleasant to be around otherwise, and as she was performing so well in her schoolwork, Lyla’s parents allowed this. Lyla made a homemade ‘Please Stay Out’ sign with a picture of a meditating giraffe. Lyla’s parents forbid her two sisters from entering the room whenever Lyla hung the sign on her door. </p>
                <p>On Lyla’s ninth birthday, two men claiming to be agents from the CIA came to the Bell’s house asking for Lyla. Mr. and Mrs. Bell refused to allow the men to talk to their daughter. The men reported that it was a matter of government security to have a short, private conversation with Lyla. What’s more, if they did not speak with Lyla now, they would be back with a warrant for Mr. and Mrs. Bell’s arrest for obstruction of justice. Not the type to be bullied, the parents slammed the door and returned to cutting Lyla’s cake.
                    </p>
                <p>The following week, a black unmarked SUV pulled into the Bell’s house while Mr. and Mrs. Bell were at work and the children were at home with their nanny. When the nanny answered the door and saw several men in black suits and sunglasses, she panicked and froze. The men pushed past her and called out for Lyla. Stella, Lyla’s 6 year old agreeable but rule-following sister, told the men that they were not allowed to talk to Lyla right now, because she was in her room meditating. The two men went to her room, did not heed the ‘Please Stay Out’ sign, and opened the door. They grabbed Lyla and ran out of the house as she screamed bloody murder.</p>
                <p>Later that evening, Mrs. Bell returned to their home to find out what happened. Terrified, she immediately called the police and reported that her child was kidnapped. Mr. Bell returned shortly after. His wife was at his car door before he could get out, screaming through tears. “Where were you?! Why haven’t you answered your phone?!” Mr. Bell jumped out of his car and ran through the house, shouting his daughter’s name. At the kitchen table, Stella sat quietly, patting the back of her sobbing little sister, Mae.
                    </p>
                <p>-----------</p>
                <p>Mr. and Mrs. Bell lost weeks of sleep as they searched everywhere for Lyla. The police and local volunteers combed the neighborhoods but were unsuccessful in locating any clues to her whereabouts. When the Bell’s tried to contact the CIA, they were transferred to an agent who reported that he knew nothing about their daughter and suggested they call the local police. After the police search turned up fruitless, the Bells hired a private detective. The detective came back after several weeks and told the Bell’s that she found nothing and could not in good conscience continue to take their money.
                    </p>
                <p>One day the Bell’s received a call from a doctor at Shadow Ridge. The doctor introduced himself as Dr. Serroe said he had been recently assigned to Lyla’s case and apologized for his lack of timeliness as he caught up with all of his new patients. He asked Mr. Bell to come to the office to discuss something he had discovered when looking through Lyla’s charts.</p>
                <p>Mr. and Mrs. Bell packed up their remaining children and drove to Shadow Ridge the following day. Dr. Serroe showed that in Lyla’s file, there were several notes that vaguely mentioned Lyla’s “accelerating condition”. He asked whether they knew what that referred to, because from her charts it seemed as if Lyla’s condition was stable. The bewildered parents shook their heads. Dr. Serroe asked if he might be able to take a look at Lyla today, if she was present. 
                    </p>
                <p>The parents exchanged a look and then explained that Lyla had been kidnapped weeks earlier. Dr. Serroe listened with shock as the Bells recapitulated their harrowing tale. He apologized for bothering them in their troubling times, and told them to please call and let him know when they found Lyla. Mrs. Bell took it as a small kindness that Dr. Serroe had said “when” they found Lyla, and not “if”. </p>
                <p>------------</p>
                <p>A few years later, the Bells’ life had developed into a new normal. It was an unspoken agreement to not mention Lyla’s name. The family was eating lunch when there was a knock on the door. Mr. Bell went to answer it and found Dr. Serroe. Mrs. Bell leapt to the door to join her husband. Dr. Serroe nodded grimly, noticing the recognition in their eyes.</p>
                <p>“I have something I wanted to give you. I found it a couple days ago, and I’m sorry it has taken me so long to deliver it. I should have called immediately, but, I -” he stammered for a couple moments, then continued, “I’ve been going to all the parents in person.”</p>
                <p>The Bells looked at each other. Mrs. Bell opened her mouth to speak, but Dr. Serroe continued.</p>
                <p>“Lyla” (Mrs. Bell cringed involuntarily at hearing the name) “was not the only gifted child to come to Shadow Ridge. There were several others. Others that also went missing. I had a suspicion, ever since talking with you several years ago, that something was not quite right at that place. At first I kept my head down, but…” Dr. Serroe hesitated, biting his lip. “Oh, you don’t want to hear all my story, and my excuses, I’m sure. But, here, take this.”
                    </p>
                <p>Dr. Serroe ungracefully shoved a binder into Mr. Bell’s hands. “There are journal entries in there written by your daughter. Some quite recently, you’ll find.”</p>
                <p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Bell eyes shot open. As one, they opened their mouths to speak, but again Dr. Serroe cut them off before they could say anything.</p>
                <p>“I assure you, I don’t know where she is. I wish I did. I don’t know where any of them are. But I found that journal in a locked room on one of the upper floors at Shadow Ridge. There was a whole box of them. All written by other young patients that also went missing.”</p>
                <p>Mrs. Bell could not contain herself any longer and blurted out, “But that means somebody there knows! Somebody knows where my daughter is! You have to go and ask whoever is in charge and -”</p>
                <p>Dr. Serroe cut her off. “Ma’am, I am never going back there. Right after I took that box of journals, they locked all the doors in the whole building and wouldn’t let anybody in or out for hours. Somebody must have noticed they were gone. I literally was about to jump out the window and run for it when I realized I would never get far - or get the journals to the parents - if they knew it was me who took them.”</p>
                <p>A branch cracked behind Dr. Serroe. He whipped his head over his shoulder, his eyes darting around, scanning the yard. Then he let out a nervous chuckle, “Sorry, a little paranoid I guess…” he glanced back at the wide eyes of Mr. and Mrs. Bell. “I need to go. I’m sure you can appreciate that the other parents would like to know as soon as possible.” He moved off towards his car. </p>
                <p>Before Dr. Serroe reached his car, he turned to look over his shoulder, but did not make eye contact. “Read it,” he said, pointing towards the binder in Mr. Bell’s hands. “Your daughter wrote more clearly than most of the others. I’m sure you’ll be able to understand it better than me.” Then he hustled back to his car.
                    </p>
                <p>“Wait! There has to be -” Mrs. Bell shouted towards the rapidly departing figure, and took a step towards the driveway.</p>
                <p>“Read it!” Dr. Serroe yelled as he slammed his car door. He fired the ignition and sped off.
                    </p>
                <p>Just then Mae appeared at the doorway between the dining room and the foyer. “Who was that?”
                    </p>
                <p>The Bells looked down at the binder and noticed their hands were trembling. Mr. Bell reached and opened to the first page. It didn’t take long for them to realize they were going to need help deciphering what they saw.</p>
