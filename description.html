        <p>Become a detective, investigate the lovely Greenville area, get some exercise, and solve a mystery. </p>
        <p>The scavenger hunt is an outdoor experience designed to highlight Greenville's landmarks. First, gather together your best detectives. The course works best with a team of 3-6 people.</p>
        <p>Your team will receive a binder with a map and clues. Visit the designated spots on the map and use the clues to solve the puzzle associated with that location. Once you've solved each puzzle, you will be able to decipher the final solution and solve the crime.</p>
        <p>The difficulty of puzzles is challenging but rewarding. While children will be able to understand some clues, the majority of the puzzles are suited for adults.</p>
        <p>The course is located in downtown Greenville, including the campus of East Carolina University (ECU). Visiting each location will require you to walk 3-4 miles. Visit each location if you're spry, or divy up the puzzles amongst your team if you must.</p>
